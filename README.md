# React Cart

- This is my first react mini-project where i try to learn the basics of react using vite
- It was useful to me to learn :
  - How to use components in react
  - How to work with useState hook to re-render the DOM when the user interacts
  - How to share state variables and other between components with props
  - I also used for the first time Tailwind CSS (there is 0 CSS in this mini prject)

### TODOS

- add hover effects
- add some animations (maybe)
